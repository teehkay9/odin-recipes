# odin-recipes

The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website to showcase my HTML skills I've learned so far.
At the end I want to cover the basic HTML concepts like links and text.
Don't judge the book by its cover now, the styling with CSS will come at a later point!
For now just enjoy the tastefulness recipes here.
